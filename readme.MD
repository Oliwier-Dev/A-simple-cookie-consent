Cookie Popup Landing Page

This is a simple landing page I built with a cookie popup. Nothing crazy, just clean HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No frameworks and no libraries. I wanted to keep it simple and focus on the basics.

When you open the page, a popup shows up in the bottom right corner. It fades and scales in smoothly. If you click the button, it hides and saves your choice in localStorage. After that, it won’t show again when you refresh the page.

The idea was just to practice UI details and simple logic. Smooth transitions, clean layout and basic state control. Everything is handled with classes and localStorage, so the code stays clear and easy to understand.

This project is small, but it’s built properly.

I made the project based on this description: https://roadmap.sh/projects/cookie-consent
